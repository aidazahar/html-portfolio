<p>Hi there, I'm Grizzly. Beloved and adorable stuffy representing an unknown creature, proudly owned by the even more adorable Sophie.</p>

<p>I am 4 weeks old, about one and half foot tall, have an oversized head and come complete with 2 feet, but curiouskly no hands hmm! </p>

<p>However my most distinctive feature is undoubtedly my fine fur, featuring a novel but tasteful mix of turquoise, blue and purple. An enviable combination. </p>

<p>I love above all else getting cuddles from Sophie. However, she spends a large part of her day at school, learning awesome new things everyday, hanging out and playing with her friends and doing a bunch of other exciting activities. So whilst she's away, I am trying to keep myself busy and distracted by teaching myself web development, with the aim of one day teaching the world about me and my kind.</p>
