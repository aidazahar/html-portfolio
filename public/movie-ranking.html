<h1>The Best Movies Ever According to Grizzly</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Elemental</h3>
<p>Animated film. Water boy falls in love with fire girl. A romance doomed to fail. Except that (spoiler alert) it didn't!</p>

<h3>Despicable Me</h3>
<p>Another animated movie. Starring a stumpy villain dressed in grey and an army of kooky but adorable yellow minions. Love them!</p>

<h3>Trolls</h3>
<p>And another animated film! Featuring cool pint-sized creatures with bright coloured hairdos, singing and dancing to an impressive repertoire of catchy tunes. A joyous ode to the boybands of the 1990s.</p>
